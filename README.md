## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Trying to get the hero section to look as close as the design was pretty confusing initially because of how I imagine the layout could look like. After trial and error with Flexbox and CSS Grid I think the section looks as intended though I took quite a long time to figure it out.
